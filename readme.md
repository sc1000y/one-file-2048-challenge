新年快乐！诸君！\
Happy New Year! EVERY ONE!\
这是一个单文件2048的挑战，任何能在单个html文件中实现2048的commit均视为有效，最小的为胜者，有人想试试吗？\
This is a single-file 2048 challenge. Any commit that can implement 2048 game in a VERY ONLY single HTML file is considered valid, with the smallest file size being the winner. Does anyone want to give it a try?\
目前来看没有奖金，但是谁说的好呢？\
So far, there’s no prize, but who knows? There might be some additional rules, but I haven’t thought them through yet. \
可能会有些额外规则，但是我没想好，也许本md也会更新，无所谓了。\
Maybe this file will be updated too, no matter. \
玩的开心。\
Have fun playing.  


1.目前某北航同学压缩至1.4k，经测试可正常运行，但是没正式push, any way,祝他好运。\
1.Some BUAA student compressed it to 1.4k. It runs smoothly after testing, but hasn't been officially pushed yet. Anyway, wish him luck.
